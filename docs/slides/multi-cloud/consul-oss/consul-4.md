Consul Adoption Journey
-------------------------

???
As we start to dive into how to use consul it is important to think about how you would go about adopting this in your environments.  

First and foremost adopting a standard way of service discovery across a single application of federation of applications is a critical first step.  

Because of this we will begin with looking at consul's robust feature set around service discovery.

Service Discovery and Load Balancers
-------------------------

.center[![:scale 45%](images/consul-service-discovery.001.png)]

* Services location is paramount
* Traditionally done with load balancers
   * Expensive
   * Hard to maintain
   * Load grows as you scale
   * Requires health probes for every backend system
???
The current mode of operation for handling service discovery is usually done with load balancers 

When I want to provision a new service it gets deployed and then the network team is notified that they need to configure the virtual IPs on the load balancer to pick up the service and start routing traffic to it.  This is time consuming, error prone, and can typically have long lead times.  

Consul can solve this problem.

Service Discovery with Consul
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 60%](images/consul-service-discovery.002.png)]
* Services self-register
* Service health is defined by the service and maintained by the consul agent
* Services are able to query each other via DNS or HTTP

???
In a consul environment services are able to self register along with their unique health check requirements.  This makes it easy to define a healthy service.  

This coupled with consul using gossip service routing and availability is near real time.  

This allows for service discovery to be offloaded from the network and load balancer teams to the application deployment pipeline.  

This is a crucial first step esp if an organization wants to take advantage of the benefits of a service mesh.

Solve Network Problems with Service Discovery
-------------------------
Consul prepared queries allow you to build logic into your DNS based service catalog. This enables transparent failover when the primary datacenter becomes unavailable.

```json
{
  "Name": "banking-app",
  "Service": {
    "Service": "banking-app",
    "Tags": ["v1.2.3"],
    "Failover": {
      "Datacenters": ["dc2", "dc3"]
    }
  }
}
```

Example
-------------------------

There are many other practical use cases that can be solved with the Consul catalog. Some of these scenarios include: automatic routing of traffic to healthy nodes, blue/green deployments, service locks, configuration management and more.

???
Because consul is now at the heart of service routing based on service name then failover becomes defined at the service level.  Simply by setting the failover path in your registration you have defined what happens in a failure situation at the service level.  Having this granular path allows for built-in resiliency for downstream dependencies.

Secure Networking is Hard
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 50%](images/consul-service-discovery.003.png)]

* Once applications can find each other security becomes the next concern
* This is usually done with a heavy dose of firewalls
* This adds significant burden to the network organization
* Huge lists of firewall rules

???
Now that service discovery is solved, our applications can find each other and now we need to secure them.  Once again the over burdened network team has to create ip based firewall rules.  These grow as applications grow.  Moving into microservices and short lived services these rules can become an exponential problem.  

To work around this problem teams are opening up entire subnets, and large port ranges compromising their security profile in an attempt to keep up with demand and improve service to service stability.

Firewalls Won't Scale
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 70%](images/consul-service-discovery.004.png)]
* Heavy interdependencies
* Hard to automate
* Hard to optimize

???
If you take this mindset to its logical conclusion you will end up with something like this. 

Firewalls at every service trying to maintain all the up and downstream communications channels. 

At scale this is completely unmanageable.

-------------------------
.center[![:scale 80%](images/consul-service-discovery.005.png)]

???
Using consul in conjunction with a proxy (in this case Envoy) will allow for several things.
First using consul ACL tokens you give a service an identity that is not IP based.  With this token the service is able to present an identity that is tied to the service no matter where it is running.
Second you have defined intentions.  This construct is how you define what service is allowed to talk to what service.  And thirdly it provides all the near real time configurations to support a mTLS connection between services.  Things like Certificates and proxy configs are all automatically handled by consul.
The power of this is that all of this can be defined in a simple service definition.

Consul Service Definition
-------------------------

```hcl
services {
  name = ‚Äúweb-app"
  port = 9090
  connect {
    sidecar_service {
      port = 20000
      proxy {
        local_service_address = "127.0.0.1"
        local_service_port = 9090
        upstreams {
          destination_name = ‚Äúorder-processing‚Äù
          local_bind_port = 8003
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

???
As you can see in this example all the connection definition is simply defined as a part of the service definition.

???
Now at scale inside a service mesh there might start to be some issue with all these connection zipping around between datacenters and clouds.  It becomes a lot more difficult to maintain good network edge security when you have a wide berth of communication happening even if the port range is well defined.

Consul Mesh Gateways

???
This problem is addressed with the availability of mesh gateways.  

This allows a single point at the edge that all mesh traffic flows over.  

So the network teams can control the ingress/egress points at the edge of the network 

while still allowing the app teams the flexibility to run application components on the platform of their choosing.  

In the next lab we are going to explore the concepts of a service mesh in instruqt.
