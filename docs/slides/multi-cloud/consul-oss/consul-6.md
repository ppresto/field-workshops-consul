Service Segmentation - Intro
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 100%](images/consul_segmentation_intro.png)]

In a sophisticated environment, Consul provides a distributed service mesh to connect, secure, and configure services across any runtime platform and cloud.

Consul provides an API driven control plane, which integrates with proxies for the data plane.

This allows critical functionality like naming, segmentation and authorization, and routing to be handled by proxies at the edge rather than using centralized middleware.

???
Consul Connect provides an API driven control plane.

It uses proxies like Envoy for its data plane.  

Consul in conjunction with Envoy allows critical functionality like identity, authorization, and routing to be handled by proxies at the edge rather than using centralized middleware.

Service Segmentation - Intro
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 100%](images/consul_segmentation_intro.png)]

Consul enables fine grained service segmentation to secure service-to-service communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization.

Consul can be integrated with common centralized PKI and certificate management.

Service configuration is achieved through API-driven Key/Value store that can be used to easily configure services at runtime in any environment.

Service Mesh Architecture - Control Plane
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 100%](images/connect_control_plane.png)]

The Control Plane is responsible for making decisions about where to send the traffic and to configure the data plane. Additionally, it is also responsible for features like network policy enforcement and providing service discovery data to the data plane.

Consul is the control plane for the Connect service mesh:

* Single source of truth for service catalog, routing, and access policies
* Manages registered services and health checks for that node
* Manages certificates and access policies and configures the proxy

Service Mesh Architecture - Data Plane
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 100%](images/connect_control_plane.png)]

The Data Plane provides the ability to forward requests from the applications, including more sophisticated features like health checking, load balancing, circuit breaking, authentication, and authorization.

The Data Plane is in the critical path of data flow from one application to the other and hence the need for high throughput and low latency.

The Consul Envoy integration is currently the primary way to utilize advanced layer 7 features provided by Consul, but can integrate with other third party proxies.

Service Mesh - Identity
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 100%](images/connect_certificate_service_identity.png)]

Consul provides each service with an identity encoded as a TLS certificate.

* Provide service identity
* Encryption of all traffic
* Standard TLS certificate with SPIFFE compatibility
* Built-in certificate authority (CA) or integrated with 3rd party CA, such as Vault

* Logical service name (not IP)
* Scales independent of instances
* Consistency insured with Raft
* Manage with web UI, CLI, and API
* Multi-datacenter support

Service Mesh - Advanced Routing
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 100%](images/consul_L7_routing.png)]

Layer 7 traffic management allows operators to divide L7 traffic between different subsets of service instances when using Connect.

There are many ways you may wish to carve up a single datacenter's pool of services beyond simply returning all healthy instances for load balancing:

* Canary testing
* A/B tests
* Blue/Green deploys

Service Mesh - Mesh Gateways
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 80%](images/connect_mesh_gateways.png)]

Mesh gateways enable routing of Connect traffic between different Consul datacenters:

* Datacenters can reside in different clouds or runtime environments where general interconnectivity between all services in all datacenters isn't feasible.
* Gateways operate by sniffing the SNI header out of the Connect session and then route the connection to the appropriate destination based on the server name requested.
* The data within the Connect session is not decrypted by the Gateway.

???
Mesh Gateways act as layer 4 routers enabling service mesh traffic between different consul data centers.  They never decrypt the data.  The read the SNI header to route the data to the correct destination.
